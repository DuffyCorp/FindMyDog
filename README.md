### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- models/
|- providers/
|- resources/
|- responsive/
|- screens/
|- utils/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- models - Models for creating and storing data in Firebase. This allows easy creation of new data objects for firebase as well as coverting them from a firebase snapshot to JSON data to be used within the application.
2- providers - Contains providers for the application for receiveing the users location, if theyre logged in and push notifications.
3- resources -  Contains all methods for interacting with FirebaseAuth, Firestore and FirebaseStorage.
4- responsive - Contains the code for adapting the code to show different content based on mobile or web incase of future expansion to a built in web application.
5- screensâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains all the screens shown in the application.
6- utilsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains files for storing variables to be accessed later within the application.
7- widgetsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the code for reusable "widgets" the Flutter equivalent to components.
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application.
```

## Conclusion

I hope you have success in installing the application and can see its full array of features ðŸ™‚
